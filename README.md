# React Router Link Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`.  The problem lies in the unexpected behavior of the `Link` component when trying to navigate between routes. The URL in the address bar does not reflect the new route, and the corresponding component does not render.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Click the "Go to About" link.  Observe that the URL remains at `/`, and the about page does not render.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `Link` component is correctly used within the context of the `BrowserRouter` and that the routes are properly defined.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation.
